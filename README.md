# Final Thesis Code - Mirle Willems - 2002654

This repository exists of the following elements:

### Attribute classifiers:
This folder contains code for training all Attribute classifiers. These classifiers are divided into three main attributes: Hood, Closure, Length and Style. Moreover, it contains, per main attribute, the code to split the dataset inot train, test and valiation set. 

### Linear SVMs
This folder contains code to fit all Linear SVMs, calculate the conditional entropy and plot the t-SNE plot, divided per attribute. 

### Splitting data - One vs Rest approach
This folder contains the code to split the dataset of non-binary attributes into binary ones and includes the csv files with the images and corresponding labels.

### StyleGAN respository
This folder contains all scripts originated from the StyleGAN repository that has been altered or added to perform this research.

#### Attribute Vectors Correlation Matrix
Contains the code to create the correlation matrix of the attribute vectors.

#### Exploration PIM Dataset
Contains the code that explored the PIM dataset.

#### Resize and Reshape scraped images Zalando
